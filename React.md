## 📘 What is Component
A component in React is a reusable, independent piece of UI that controls how part of the screen looks and behaves.

Think of components like building blocks — just like LEGO pieces.
Each component can contain:

1.HTML (JSX)
2.CSS
3.JavaScript logic (state, functions)
4.Props (input values)
5.Lifecycle methods (component mount, update, unmount)
